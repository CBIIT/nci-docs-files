*************************************

  - Materialized views were fixed to remove duplicates in classes and
    attributes. (GF 4546)

  - Inherited classes without model specific definitions were not
    displaying properly in the UML Model Browser. To fix this bug report, since
    model owner documentation is a caBIG compatibility requirement, the missing 
    definitions were added by curators using original model owner
    documentation. Where no definition was provided in the model documentation,
    the definition was set to "No definition loaded". (GF 4092)
 
  - Inherited attributes did not have any definitions and were not displaying
    in the UML Model Browser. Definitions were added to the inherited
    attributes as

        childClass definition + parentClassAttribute definition

    Where no definition was provided in the model documentation, the definition
    was set to "No definition loaded". (GF 4092)

  - Alt Def type has been changed to "UML Class:UML Attr" instead of
    "UML Class : UML Attr". (GF 3133)

*************************************

  - Classes still show up twice in the same model in search results
    Workaround: The UML Model Browser view uses class names and definitions
                for each model to display results. If a class has two names are for
                a given model this will cause it be included in the view twice, once 
                for each definition.  The fix is to edit the Object Class in caDSR 
                Admin Tool view the alternate definitions 'classifications', and 
                eliminate the duplicate. 
  
  - When sorting columns of results, the column name appears only when the 
    default column is used as the sort method. The column name is omitted when
    choosing any other column. The result being the users do not know which
    column is being used to sort. (GF 7145)

  - When a UML Model Browser session expires two links appear to refresh the
    session.  Both of these links, the HOME icon and the word "here", reference
    an invalid URL. (GF 7166)

  - Reset button does not clear the version field. (GF 7203)

  - After versioning a CS, only the new CS appears in the tree. However both
    versions appear in the search drop-down. (GF 7362)
