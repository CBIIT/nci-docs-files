- SIW splits Concept definitions tagged values that are longer than 255 characters to several 
tagged values to represent all the definition parts so it can be re-imported into Enterprise Architect. 
A maximum of 8 tags is allowed. The format for the tag names is an extension of the existing concpet tag 
names adding "_n" where n = 2-8.  e.g. ObjectClassConceptDefinition_2, or ObjectClassQualifierConceptDefinition1_2. 
The same format applies for Property and ValueMeaning tag names when concept definitions exceed 255. (GF 5442)

     NOTE: If you already have an XMI file with long concept definitions (>255 characters), 
     you must open the XMI file in SIW 3.2.0.1.  You must make a change to the class/attribute, 
     such that SIW will mark it for resaving, then you must resave the XMI file.  An example of 
     marking the class/attribute for resaving would be to add a concept then immediately delete it. 
     This will require you to click the Apply button.  It this Apply button that marks a 
     class/attribute to be resaved into the XMI file, subsequently splitting the tags in this process.
     Also note that if there are several classes/attributes that use the same concept, you must 
     resave EACH of those class/attributes in order to get the changes made throughout the XMI file.

- SIW flags split Concept definitions that skip a number.  (GF 6394)
    e.g _2, _3, _5 without _4 would throw an error. 

- Reordering of concepts for permissible values has been fixed.  (GF 4742)
   Previous version would sometimes lose the ordering of the valuemeaning concepts after 
   navigating away from the item.

- Reordering of concepts for associations has been fixed. (GF 5378)
    Previous version would sometimes lose the ordering of the valuemeaning concepts after 
    navigating away from the item.

- SIW should flag errors when sequential tag definitions skip a number or are invalid (GF 6396). 


**************************************
********  Known Issues ***************
**************************************

- When an invalid tag names is found, the error message is incomplete, you can't tell which XML element
  the invalid tag is associated with. 
 
  Workaround: You can turn on the java console before launching SIW and all errors are logged. You can view the 
  exact location of the error, or copy the file and paste into notepad to review it. To turn on Java console, go
  to the Control Panel, open "Java", click "advanced" >> java console >> select "Show Console".  An alternative is
  to search the xmi file for the string appearing after the text "Tagged Value .."
