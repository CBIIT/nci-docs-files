SIW 3.2
March 2007


*************************************
************ New Features  **********
*************************************

- Semantic Connector now writes directly into the XMI file using the
  NCICB XMI Handler. The csv file format is deprecated

- SIW's new XMI Handler opens the default EA XMI exported format.
  SIW no longer uses or opens "fixed xmi" files.

- SIW now uses Freestyle to query Data Elements. The fields
  displayed have been modified.

- Data Element serach results now display workflow status

- Search Preferences allow filtering Data Elements by Workflow to
  exclude "Retired", "Retired Withdrawn" etc 

- SIW can now suggest CDE mappings based on the UML Class
  and Attribute names

- SIW can display inherited attributes for a class

- Semantic connector's performance has improved

- Association roles, source role and target role can now be annotated

- Users can now review unannotated XMI files. This mode does
  not display missing concept errors for unmapped classes or attributes
  so users   can more easily focus on other errors and warnings such as
  missing class and attribute descriptions, unreferenced Value Domains, 
  and invalid datatype.  It will display errors for mapped concepts
  when present in the XMI file, but doesn't flag that they are missing
  like   it will in the Review Annotated XMI file where it expects that
  all elements will be mapped to either CDEs or Concepts.

- The errors in SIW can now be exported in XML format by right clicking
  on 'Errors' panel and selecting "Export Errors"  
 
- The number of results displayed at a time is now configurable for
  all searches: EVS Link, Search Data Element and Search for Value Domains 

- SIW now offers the ability to expand and collapse the navigation tree

- SIW offers ability to sort elements in the tree by name

- NCI Pre-Thesaurus may be used to validate EVS concepts

- The Value Domain Stereotype can now either be 'enumeration' or 'CADSR Value Domain'

- Class and attributes can now have definitions longer than 255 characters
  (e.g. tag name 'description' for the attribute's 1st tag, description[n]
   without a space for 2-8, limit is 2000 characters, or 8 tags total)

- Semantic Connector includes a package filter function to exclude packages
  from beign re-run through automated concept mapping

- Concepts in the concept editor panel can be removed no matter where they
  stand in the queue

- The Value Domain Panel now displays publicID and datatype

- CDE search results now display workflow status

- CDE Search Preferences allow filtering by Workflow to exckude "Retired",
  "Retired Withdrawn" etc 

- SIW displays a warning when two classes are tied by more than one association

- SIW warns the user when mapping a CDE to an attribute results in
  automatically mapping the CDE's Object Clas to the attributes owning Class

************               **********
************ Known Issues  **********
************               **********
*************************************

- On Microsoft Windows, it has been found that dialog windows are sometimes
  placed behind the main window, which renders the application unusable until
  the dialog is placed to the front. 

Workaround: 
- Minimizing other windows or using the "show desktop" feature sometimes fixes
  this issue, (Windows "Start" button + "D"), as well as closing all Mozilla Windows.  

- UML Loader 3.2 requires that descriptions and documentations be provided for
  all classes and attributes. SIW however marks missing descriptions as a warning. 
  Users should treat them as errors.
