UML Loader 3.2
May 2007


*************************************
************ New Features  **********
*************************************

  - The Loader raises a Warning message if the CDE to which an Attribute is
  mapped is not the latest version (GF#968)

  - The Loader will now handle Class and Attribute Definitions that are
  greater than 255 characters long (an EA limit).  This is done using a series
  of tags, e.g. "documentation[n]" to hold parts of the long definition ([n] can
  range up to 8). (GF#1039)

  - The Loader now accepts three possibilities for annotating associations:
  (1)The source role; (2) The target role; and (3) The association itself
  (GF#1072)

  - The tagged value names for Value Domains and Value Meanings now more accurately
  describe their content (GF#1077):
  
    For Value Domains:
      ValueDomainConceptCode
      ValueDomainConceptPreferredName

    For Value Meanings:
      ValueMeaningConceptCode
      ValueMeaningConceptPreferredName

  - UML Loader not inserting Effective Begin Date for new Object Class
  and Concept Classes. The new concept classes created by UML Loader
  will have an effective begin date = date created. (GF#839)

  - UML Loader should be setting the Alternate Name and Definition
  language to English by default.  The default language is now English.
  (GF#2982)

  - UML Loader loads concepts for permissible values backwards.  This
  has been corrected (GF#2989)

  - Permissible Values in enumerated VDs cannot be loaded without a
  concept. Enumerated Permissible Values can now be loaded with no
  concept mapping.  The load log now states which permissible values
  did not get loaded. (GF#3080)

  - Update VM description if it's missing.   If a concept code
  matches exactly to a VM on Production  and the VM does not have
  a description (blank), then the VM description is updated
  with the EVS Concept Definition.  (GF#3367)

  - New VM Created with UML Loader are now getting the Effective
  Start Date set (GF3394)

  - Value Meanings created by the UML Loader are assigned a default
  definition if none is provided ("No Definition Provided") (GF#3395)

  - If a VM can't be loaded then the Loader continues to the rest
  of the VM's instead of moving to the next Value Domain. (GF#3428)

  - The UML Loader now follows the same business rules as does the Curation
  Tool when evaluating Value Meanings for reuse. (GF#3508)

  - The UML Model Loader now correctly creates Concept Derivation Rules of type
  "Concatenated" for caDSR objects associated with multiple Concepts (GF#3640)

  - The Loader now checks both CS Long Name and Version before creating a new
  CS. (GF#3998)

  - The Loader now reuses Concept Derivation Rules.  The reuse decision is
  based on the concatenation of the associated Concepts (GF#4389)

  - The Loader now creates the default alternate definition for inherited
  attributes from the childClassDocmentation tag + parentClassAttribute
  description. (GF#4515)

  - The Loader will no longer load a model with missing descriptions.  (GF#4517)

  - Attributes (Properties) are now getting the correct Alternate Name Type of "UML
  Attribute" (GF#4614)

  - The Loader now issues a Warning (only) when it encounters a Value Domain
  that is not used in the current Model.  (GF#5359)

  - The Loader now handles "Abort" requests more gracefully.
  (GF#5360)

************ Known Issues  **********
************               **********
*************************************



  - Loader will not run without UML.dtd file in source directory (GF#5905)

      ** Workround: Place the DTD file in the source directory.

  - The Loader does not ensure that CADSR_ValueDomainType = "E" for
  Enumerated Value Domains (GFE5383)

      ** Workaround: Open XMI file using notepad and change the enumeration
         type to the correct value ('E')

  - Loader reports validation errors but SIW does not report any. (GF#5363)

      ** Workaround: None.  The SIW will be enhancd to report
         additional errors.

  - Alt Def type should be "UML Class:UML Attr" instead of
    "UML Class : UML Attr" (GF#2923)

      ** Workaround: when searching for the
      alternate name, use the existing format (with spaces)
      instead of the "to-be" format

  - UML Loader should use definition from concept administered
    component, not XMI file (GF#1295)


  - Add Default definition for VM (GF#6030)

      ** Workaround: Assign definitions to all VM's
