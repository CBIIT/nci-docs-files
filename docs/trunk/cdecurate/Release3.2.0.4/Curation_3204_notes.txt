    2.0 New Features and Updates
----------------------------------------------------------------

    --  The http://.../FormalizationFailedServlet URL is now in 
        the Tools Options within the caDSR with similar 
        configuration data. (GF 3269)

    --  Added a Delete All button for the PV list. (GF 3646)

    --  Include the Context dropdown on the Add/Edit pages for 
        Alternate Names/Definitions. (GF 3877)

    --  Provide separate Edit pages for a VM using the 
        established pattern and flow of DE, DEC and VD.
        (GF 4412)

    --  Extend the Reference Document name length and CSI Label 
        to 255. (GF 4715)

    --  Sort the Context dropdowns alphabetically. (GF 6417)

    --  Change "Alternate Names" to "Alt Names/Defs" (GF 6740)

    --  Update the EVS Vocabulary references to the latest 
        production releases. (GF 6907)


----------------------------------------------------------------
    3.0 Bugs Fixed Since Last Release
----------------------------------------------------------------

    --  Concepts with long names would distort the PV list 
        display for enumerated VD’s. This is most noticeable 
        when the browser window is not maximized. (GF 3341)

    --  Adding new qualifier Concepts to a VM were not always 
        saved. (GF 3697)

    --  While searching for the CSI gov.nih.nci.ncia.domain, no 
        results were returned until the search term was 
        shortened and a wildcard suffixed. (GF 4135)

    --  When creating a new PV and editing an existing PV the 
        Concept search link is not consistent. The preferred 
        format appears during Create where a separate link, 
        "Search", appears next to the Concept label. (GF 4168)

    --  When creating an Alternate Name/Definition for any AC 
        when previously none existed, the word “null" will 
        appear under the “Sort by Type" button. (GF 4171)

    --  When creating a DEC, selecting Validate, Back and
        Validate again will cause erroneous messages to appear
        on the Validate page relating to the Object Class
        and Property. The "Back" processing did not correctly
        maintain edit values. (GF 4174)

    --  The message displayed on the Add Name and Add 
        Definition pages after selecting a CSI of Type 
        UML_PACKAGE_ALIAS is confusing. (GF 4175)

    --  When editing a PV associated to a CRF an information 
        message appears. (GF 4190)

    --  Only 2 PV’s are added when creating multiple PV’s from 
        EVS search results. (GF 4252)

    --  A spelling correction in the Reference Document Delete
        confirmation message. (GF 4309)

    --  Display a message informing the user the current business
        rules prohibit deleting a PV referenced by a CRF.
        (GF 4475)

    --  A message is displayed after selecting Save for an Alt
        Names/Def informing the user the current business rules
        require an Alternate Name be unique for the AC, Alternate
        Name Type and Alternate Name Context. (GF 4550)

    --  https:// was not being recognized as a valid URL prefix
        on the Reference Document Upload page. (GF 6081)

    --  Session data would become confused in special situations
        when 2 or more requests were made at the same time and
        1 of the requests was an update to content in the caDSR.
        This was most recently seen as the "GUEST" account
        appearing in the Created By and Modified By fields when
        the change was really made by a Curator. (GF 7915)


----------------------------------------------------------------
    4.0 Known Issues
----------------------------------------------------------------

    --  When creating or editing a list of Permissible Values
        based on EVS concepts, whether in a new or existing
        Value Domain, the Curation Tool displays a message that
        seems confusing if the Value Domain is new: "The
        following Value and Meaning already exists in the Value
        Domain. Value: ..." This message can appear when the
        user has attempted to add/create semantically equivalent
        Permissible Values.  

        This occurs when concepts from different vocabularies
        in EVS are selected as the basis for Value Meanings, but
        are found to be semantically equivalent through
        validation against the Metathesaurus. The caDSR
        business rules dictate that the PV will be based on the
        NCIt concept instead, if one exists it is reused. 
        The error message will be revised in a future release.
        (GF 6958)


    --  In the Curation Tool when an AC is Versioned, those
        Alternate Names, Definitions and Reference Documents
        associated to Contexts outside the Curator’s privileges
        are not brought forward to the new Version. The use case
        and Business Rules are being reviewed with the caDSR
        Curators and changes, if needed, will be scheduled.
        (GF 7075)
