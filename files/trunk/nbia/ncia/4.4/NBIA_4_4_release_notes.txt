Introduction
---------------------------

The National Biomedical Imaging Archive (NBIA) provides access 
to in vivo images. The goal of the NBIA is to provide 
the cancer research community,industry, and academia with 
access to an imaging data archive that will assist in the 
development and validation of analytical software tools 
supporting: lesion detection and classification, accelerated 
diagnostic imaging decision throughput, and quantitative 
imaging assessment of drug response. The repository aims to 
provide access to imaging resources that will improve the use 
of imaging in today’s cancer research and practice by: 
increasing the efficiency and reproducibility of imaging 
supporting cancer detection, improving the accuracy of imaging 
supporting cancer diagnosis, leveraging imaging to provide an 
objective assessment of therapeutic response, and ultimately 
enabling the development of imaging resources that will lead 
to confident clinical decisions in patient care.

Highlights of Features Addressed in This Release
-------------------------------------------------------------
* Shared List 
    - create:  Registered users are able to create a named list to share with 
	       community.  The list can be created based on the content of the
               data basket or by uploading a CSV file with image series instance UID.
    - Update:  The list creator is able to update the content of the list by 
               uploading a CSV file with image series instance UID
    - Search:  Users (public or registered) are able to search the shared list 
	       and add the list content to the data basket to download.
* Collection description - is integrated with NBIA application.   
     Administrator is able to modify the description of the collection with a rich 
     text editor implemented in NBIA.
* Two tier deletion process
      - The curator set one or more image series status as "To be deleted" via 
        redesigned QC tool
      - The super curator review the series marked as "To be deleted", and
        approve the deletion or not.
      - The actual deletion will happen at a system configured time.
* Online deletion - allow administrator to delete 
* Re-designed QC tool allows the curator to search particular status with collection
  site, review the images series' thumbnails and DICOM header information, and change
  the status ("Not yet reviewed", "Visible", "Not visible", "To be deleted")
* Redesigned remote search detects othere registered NBIA grid nodes automatically,
  and provides the searchable terms of each node.  The remote search functions is 
  limited to the simple/advanced search only in this release.
